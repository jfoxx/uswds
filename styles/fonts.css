 * USWDS font-face declarations are loaded via styles/uswds-core.css

 *   - Source Sans Pro Web (body text)
 *   - Merriweather Web (headings)
 *   - Public Sans Web (alternative body font)
 *   - Roboto Mono Web (monospace/code)
 * 
 * Font files are located in /fonts/ and loaded automatically by USWDS.
 * 
 * This file is lazy-loaded by scripts/scripts.js for performance.
 * Since USWDS fonts are already declared in uswds-core.css (loaded in head),
 * no additional @font-face declarations are needed here.

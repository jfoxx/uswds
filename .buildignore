# Files that should NOT be regenerated by build-uswds.js
# 
# EDS Pattern: All block JavaScript files are custom decorators that transform
# simple content into USWDS HTML. The build script generates base CSS from USWDS.
#
# Protect ALL block JS files from regeneration:
blocks/**/*.js

# Protect CSS files with custom EDS overrides:
# (Only add CSS files here if they have custom styles beyond USWDS defaults)
#
# To update these when USWDS changes:
# 1. Comment out the file(s) you want to regenerate
# 2. Run: npm run build:uswds
# 3. Re-add your custom EDS overrides at the TOP of the file
# 4. Uncomment the protection below
#
blocks/alert/alert.css
blocks/card/card.css
blocks/header/header.css
blocks/hero/hero.css
blocks/banner/banner.css
blocks/footer/footer.css
